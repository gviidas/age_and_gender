# Age and Gender Classification Project

## Introduction
In the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the ability to accurately classify age and gender from images stands as a significant challenge with vast applications in areas like marketing, security, and demographic research. This project delves into the utilization of deep learning techniques to develop a model capable of predicting age and gender from facial images.

Using UTKface dataset of facial images, the project includes several stages, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to the development and evaluation of a neural network model. The end goal is to create a reliable and efficient classifier that can be used in real-world scenarios.
